    <div class="botom"><b>Linear Equations</b></div>
    <div>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">ax + b = 0</span></h3>
<div class="botom">
    where <span class="red">a</span> and <span class="red">b</span> are real numbers and x is 
    a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of
    a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start
    off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an x so donâ€™t 
    get too locked into always seeing an <span class="red">x</span> there.</div>
    <div class="botom"><b>Quadratic Equation</b></div>
    <div>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">ax<sup><small>2</small></sup> + bx + c = 0</span></h3>
    <div class="botom">where <span class="red">a</span>, <span class="red">b</span>, <span class="red">c</span> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
    </div>
    <div class="botom"><b>Linear Equations</b></div>
    <div><span class="red">&pi;</span> times the radius (<span class="red">r</span>) squared:</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">A = &pi; &times; r<sup><small>2</small></sup></span></h3>
    <div class="botom">or, when you know the diameter (<span class="red">D</span>):</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D<sup><small>2</small></sup></span></h3>
    <div class="botom">or, when you know the circumference(<span class="red">C</span>):</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">  A = C<sup><small>2</small></sup> / 4 &times; &pi;</span></h3>
    <div class="botom"><b>Intersection</b></div>
    <div class="botom">The intersection of two sets <span class="red">A</span> and <span class="red">B</span>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</div>
    <h3 class="center"><span class="formul">   A &#8745; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B }</span></h3>
    <div class="botom">That is, x is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if <span class="red">x</span> is both an element of <span class="red">A</span> and an element of <span class="red">B</span>.</div>
